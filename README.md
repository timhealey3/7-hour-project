## What is a 7 Hour Project
I like to build project, but I'm relatively busy. So I decided I would create one project every week. Spending one hour a day on the project. Thus each project roughly takes 7 hours.

## Projects so far:
Week 1: Do I need a jacket? https://github.com/timhealey3/do-i-need-a-jacket
