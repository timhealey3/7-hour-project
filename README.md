## What is a 7 Hour Project
I like to build project, but I'm relatively busy. So I decided I would create one project every week. Exploring new technology and ideas. Spending one hour a day on the project. Thus each project roughly takes 7 hours.

## Projects so far:
- Week 1: Do I need a jacket? https://github.com/timhealey3/do-i-need-a-jacket | Using an MCP Server to talk with my arduino board to read data from its sensors
- Week 2: Do you want to watch NHL games from your terminal? Keep track of all stats of ongoing games with this terminal app https://github.com/timhealey3/nhl-track
